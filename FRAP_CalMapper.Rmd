# Load data
```{r}
load(file = "Rdata/frap_2020_dis_Rx.Rdata")
load(file = "Rdata/CalMapper_activities_fire_2020.Rdata")
```

# Transform to match
```{r}
frap_20_diss <- st_transform(frap_diss_2020, st_crs(act_2020))
```

# Visualize
```{r}
#mapview(list(frap_20_diss, act_2020, overlaps), col.regions=list("red","blue", "green"),col=list("red","blue", "green"))
```

# It's too impossible to actually find overlaps of activity acres so I'm going to stick with dissolving them and finding footprint acreage overlap

## Dissolve 
```{r}
act_20_diss <- act_2020 %>% 
  st_union()
```

## Overlap
```{r}
overlap <- st_intersection(frap_20_diss, act_20_diss)
overlap_ha <- as.numeric(st_area(overlap)/10000) %>% 
  round()
overlap_ha
```

## Find areas of each
```{r}
frap_20_ha <- as.numeric(st_area(frap_20_diss)/10000) %>% 
  round()
calmapper_20_ha <- as.numeric(st_area(act_20_diss)/10000) %>% 
  round()
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
